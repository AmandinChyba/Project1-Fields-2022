        "2.   Here's the setup. We give an input that is an array R of values for r, and an input that is an array Θ of values for theta. \n",
        "3.   Let's say that M = length(R) and N = length(Θ). We can create a matrix **R** with N rows, each row being a copy of R, and another matrix **Θ** with M columns, each column being a copy of Θ. This means that **R,Θ** are M by N matrices. We should be able to \"stack\" one on top of the other to get the Cartesian product of the sets R and Θ. \n",
        "4.   Now, for each pair (r,θ) in R × Θ, we want to have K batches to do the Metropolis-Hastings scheme. Thus, we'll need K copies of **R** and **Θ**. We want to make sure that they're stacked correctly so that we're keeping the (r,θ) pairs together. \n",
        "5.   Once we've done that, we should be able to perform the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Note that we'll need a big matrix for the final results. If we want to do T time steps in the MH scheme, our final matrix will be (I think) M by N by K by T. This could be really large, so we might not get the results we'd like (e.g. MATLAB saying it would take too much data to store), but it should in theory be computable!\n",
